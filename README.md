# REAPER | Custom script 
## GUTAR PRO Drums to Superior Drummer in REAPER

### Imports the MIDI of a drum track from Guitar Pro 6 [GP6] and create a template REAPER project for working with Superior drummer 3 [SD3]  <br /><br /><br />


#### Yeah, but what does it really do?
Using an exported ".mid" from Guitar pro.
It creates a Track for each **group** of instruments (Snare, Bass drum, hi-hat, Toms, Crash, China, Ride)
Automatically sets the appropriate drum sticking (SD3) with a default velocity
```
Future features :
  # - Provides a config file for custom MIDI mapping (form importing not only from GP6)
  # - Provides a config file for setting a velocity with a default, or randomed range value
  # - Automatically create a track with SD3 VST enabled
  # - Automatically create audio tracks linked to SD3
  # - Provide a condig file for handeling **groups** (which midi notes should be on the same track and what is the name of that track)
```
